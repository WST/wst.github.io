Knowledge Base
==============

This is the personal knowledge base of `Ilya Averkov <https://averkov.net/>`_, where I document and share insights on programming, network administration, computer hardware, and electronics in a broad sense.

This documentation is organized into three main sections:

* **Networking** — Articles about network protocols, software, and administration.
* **Programming** — Programming guides, tutorials, and best practices.
* **Computer Hardware** — Information about computer components and hardware
