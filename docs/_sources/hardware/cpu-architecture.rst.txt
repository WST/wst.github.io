CPU Architecture
================

The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the brain of the computer, responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations. Understanding CPU architecture is essential for optimizing system performance.

CPU Components
--------------

**Control Unit (CU)**
- Manages the execution of instructions
- Coordinates between different CPU components
- Controls the flow of data

**Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**
- Performs mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Handles logical operations (AND, OR, NOT, XOR)
- Processes comparison operations

**Registers**
- Small, fast memory locations within the CPU
- Store data and instructions being processed
- Include general-purpose, special-purpose, and control registers

**Cache Memory**
- High-speed memory between CPU and RAM
- Stores frequently accessed data and instructions
- Levels: L1 (fastest, smallest), L2, L3 (largest, slower)

Instruction Cycle
-----------------

The CPU follows a four-step instruction cycle:

1. **Fetch**: Retrieve instruction from memory
2. **Decode**: Interpret the instruction
3. **Execute**: Perform the operation
4. **Write Back**: Store results in memory or registers

CPU Architecture Types
----------------------

**RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing)**
- Simple, fixed-length instructions
- Fewer instructions, faster execution
- Examples: ARM, MIPS, RISC-V

**CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing)**
- Complex, variable-length instructions
- More instructions, slower execution
- Examples: x86, x86-64

**Modern Hybrid Approach**
- Combines RISC and CISC concepts
- Uses microcode to translate complex instructions
- Examples: Intel Core, AMD Ryzen

CPU Performance Factors
-----------------------

**Clock Speed**
- Measured in Hertz (Hz)
- Higher frequency = more instructions per second
- Modern CPUs: 2-5 GHz range

**Cores**
- Multiple processing units on a single chip
- Parallel processing capabilities
- Common: 4, 6, 8, 16 cores

**Cache Size**
- Larger cache = better performance
- Reduces memory access latency
- L3 cache: 8-32 MB typical

**Architecture Efficiency**
- Instructions per cycle (IPC)
- Pipeline efficiency
- Branch prediction accuracy

CPU Manufacturing Process
-------------------------

**Process Node**
- Measured in nanometers (nm)
- Smaller nodes = more transistors, less power
- Current: 5-7 nm, moving to 3 nm

**Transistor Count**
- More transistors = more complex operations
- Modern CPUs: 10-50 billion transistors

**Power Efficiency**
- Performance per watt
- Thermal design power (TDP)
- Dynamic frequency scaling

Common CPU Sockets
------------------

**Intel Sockets**
- LGA 1700 (12th/13th gen Core)
- LGA 1200 (10th/11th gen Core)
- LGA 1151 (6th-9th gen Core)

**AMD Sockets**
- AM5 (Ryzen 7000 series)
- AM4 (Ryzen 1000-5000 series)
- TR4/sTRX4 (Threadripper)

CPU Selection Criteria
----------------------

1. **Intended Use**: Gaming, productivity, server
2. **Budget**: Price-performance ratio
3. **Compatibility**: Socket, motherboard, RAM
4. **Future-proofing**: Upgrade path considerations
5. **Power requirements**: TDP and cooling needs
