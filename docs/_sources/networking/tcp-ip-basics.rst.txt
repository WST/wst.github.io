TCP/IP Basics
=============

The TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) suite is the fundamental communication protocol of the internet. It provides a set of rules that govern how data is transmitted between devices on a network.

TCP/IP Layers
-------------

The TCP/IP model consists of four layers:

1. **Application Layer**
   - Contains protocols like HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS
   - Provides services directly to user applications

2. **Transport Layer**
   - TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) - reliable, connection-oriented
   - UDP (User Datagram Protocol) - unreliable, connectionless

3. **Internet Layer**
   - IP (Internet Protocol) - handles addressing and routing
   - ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) - error reporting

4. **Network Access Layer**
   - Handles physical transmission of data
   - Includes Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and other link-layer protocols

IP Addressing
-------------

IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers divided into four octets:

.. code-block:: text

   192.168.1.1

Common IP address classes:

- **Class A**: 1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255
- **Class B**: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255  
- **Class C**: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255

Subnetting
----------

Subnetting allows you to divide a network into smaller, more manageable networks:

.. code-block:: text

   Network: 192.168.1.0/24
   Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
   Available hosts: 254 (1-254)

TCP vs UDP
----------

**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**
- Connection-oriented
- Reliable delivery
- Ordered data transmission
- Used for: web browsing, email, file transfer

**UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**
- Connectionless
- Unreliable delivery
- No ordering guarantee
- Used for: streaming, gaming, DNS queries

Common Ports
------------

- **Port 80**: HTTP
- **Port 443**: HTTPS
- **Port 22**: SSH
- **Port 21**: FTP
- **Port 25**: SMTP
- **Port 53**: DNS
