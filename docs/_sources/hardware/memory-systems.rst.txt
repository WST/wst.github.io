Memory Systems
==============

Computer memory systems are hierarchical storage solutions that balance speed, capacity, and cost to provide optimal performance for different types of data access.

Memory Hierarchy
----------------

**CPU Registers**
- Fastest access (1-2 clock cycles)
- Smallest capacity (32-64 bits per register)
- Located within the CPU
- Used for immediate calculations

**Cache Memory**
- Very fast access (2-10 clock cycles)
- Small capacity (KB to MB)
- Located on CPU die or nearby
- Stores frequently accessed data

**Main Memory (RAM)**
- Fast access (50-100 clock cycles)
- Large capacity (GB to TB)
- Volatile storage
- Primary working memory

**Storage (SSD/HDD)**
- Slow access (milliseconds)
- Very large capacity (GB to TB)
- Non-volatile storage
- Long-term data storage

RAM Types
---------

**DDR4 (Double Data Rate 4)**
- Current standard for most systems
- Speeds: 2133-3200 MHz
- Lower power consumption
- Higher bandwidth than DDR3

**DDR5 (Double Data Rate 5)**
- Latest generation
- Speeds: 4800-6400 MHz
- Higher bandwidth and efficiency
- Error correction capabilities

**LPDDR (Low Power DDR)**
- Used in mobile devices
- Lower power consumption
- Integrated into system-on-chip
- LPDDR4, LPDDR5 variants

**ECC Memory (Error-Correcting Code)**
- Detects and corrects memory errors
- Used in servers and workstations
- Slightly slower than non-ECC
- Higher reliability

Memory Channels
---------------

**Single Channel**
- One memory channel
- Basic configuration
- Lower bandwidth
- Suitable for basic systems

**Dual Channel**
- Two memory channels
- Doubles bandwidth
- Most common configuration
- Requires matched memory modules

**Quad Channel**
- Four memory channels
- High-end desktop and server
- Maximum bandwidth
- Requires specific motherboard support

Memory Timing
-------------

**CAS Latency (CL)**
- Number of clock cycles for data access
- Lower is better
- CL16, CL18, CL20 common values

**Memory Speed**
- Measured in MHz
- Higher speed = more bandwidth
- Must be supported by CPU and motherboard

**Timing Example**
- DDR4-3200 CL16
- 3200 MHz speed
- 16 clock cycle latency
- 10 ns actual latency

Virtual Memory
--------------

**Paging System**
- Extends RAM using storage
- Page files and swap partitions
- Memory management unit (MMU)
- Translation lookaside buffer (TLB)

**Memory Mapping**
- Maps files to memory addresses
- Shared memory between processes
- Memory-mapped I/O
- Demand paging

**Memory Protection**
- Process isolation
- Read/write permissions
- Memory segmentation
- Address space layout randomization (ASLR)

Memory Optimization
-------------------

**Memory Pooling**
- Pre-allocated memory blocks
- Reduces allocation overhead
- Common in game engines
- Database systems

**Garbage Collection**
- Automatic memory management
- Mark and sweep algorithms
- Reference counting
- Generational collection

**Memory Alignment**
- Data structure optimization
- Cache line alignment
- SIMD instruction requirements
- Performance benefits

**Memory Compression**
- Compress inactive memory pages
- Increase effective memory capacity
- CPU overhead trade-off
- Windows, Linux, macOS support

Memory Selection Criteria
-------------------------

1. **Capacity**: Match workload requirements
2. **Speed**: Balance with CPU capabilities
3. **Compatibility**: Check motherboard specifications
4. **Channels**: Dual/quad channel configuration
5. **ECC**: Error correction for critical systems
6. **Latency**: Lower CAS latency for better performance
7. **Brand**: Reliable manufacturers
8. **Warranty**: Long-term support
