Network Security
================

Network security is essential for protecting data, systems, and network infrastructure from unauthorized access, attacks, and data breaches.

Threat Landscape
----------------

Common network security threats:

- **Malware**: Viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware
- **Phishing**: Social engineering attacks
- **DDoS**: Distributed Denial of Service attacks
- **Man-in-the-Middle**: Intercepting communications
- **SQL Injection**: Database attacks
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Web application attacks

Security Layers
---------------

**Perimeter Security**
- Firewalls (hardware and software)
- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
- Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)
- Demilitarized Zones (DMZ)

**Network Access Control**
- Authentication and authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Network segmentation
- VLANs and access lists

**Data Protection**
- Encryption (at rest and in transit)
- Data loss prevention (DLP)
- Backup and recovery
- Secure protocols (HTTPS, SSH, SFTP)

Firewall Configuration
----------------------

Basic firewall rules:

.. code-block:: text

   # Allow HTTP traffic
   iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
   
   # Allow HTTPS traffic
   iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
   
   # Allow SSH from specific IP
   iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -s 192.168.1.100 -j ACCEPT
   
   # Drop all other traffic
   iptables -A INPUT -j DROP

VPN Technologies
----------------

**Site-to-Site VPN**
- Connects multiple office locations
- Uses IPsec or GRE tunnels
- Provides secure communication

**Remote Access VPN**
- Allows remote users to access corporate network
- SSL/TLS or IPsec protocols
- Two-factor authentication recommended

**Wireless Security**
- WPA3 encryption (latest standard)
- Strong passwords and passphrases
- MAC address filtering
- Regular security audits

Security Best Practices
-----------------------

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep systems and software patched
2. **Strong Authentication**: Use multi-factor authentication
3. **Network Monitoring**: Implement logging and alerting
4. **Employee Training**: Security awareness programs
5. **Incident Response**: Have a plan for security incidents
6. **Regular Audits**: Security assessments and penetration testing
7. **Backup Strategy**: Regular backups with encryption
8. **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege
